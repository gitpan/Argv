0.27  Thu Nov 11 09:37:06 EST 1999
	- Fix Windows autoquoting again - turn embedded newlines back
	into a literal "\n" so the &*@# cmd shell can turn it BACK.

0.28  Thu Nov 11 22:09:44 EST 1999

0.30  Mon Nov 15 12:05:47 EST 1999
	- Bugfix: change shell quoting on Unix to be closer to Win32
	  (quote embedded double-quotes, then double-quote the
	  entire word, rather than try to use single quotes on Unix
	  and the above on Windows).

0.32  Tue Nov 16 16:01:56 EST 1999
	- Added an integration with IPC::ChildSafe. This
	  allows a user to request that commands be run

	- Implemented inheritance of attributes when constructor used
	  as an instance method.
	- Renamed exported qxargv() to qv().
	- Modified many methods to return the object in 'set' mode.

	- Renamed 'ipc' method to 'childsafe'.
	- Renamed 'dfltopts' method to 'dfltsets'.
	- Added 'stdopts' method.
	- Allow config data to be specified for methods calling
	  Getopt::Long::GetOptions().

	- Added 'autofail' method.
	- Cleaned up PODs some.
	- Reformatted to 4-space indenting.

0.41 Wed Jan  5 12:31:18 EST 2000
	- Renamed 'nativepath' to 'pathnorm'.
	- Worked on 'stdopts' method.
	- Removed overcomplicated 'dbglevel' stuff.

0.42 Sun Jan  9 18:15:39 EST 2000
	- POD work
	- Fixed quoting bug.
	- Defer errors to caller in ipc_childsafe call.

0.45 Fri Jan 14 21:42:12 EST 2000
	- Added anon-hash metthod of setting attrs
	- Implemented non-sticky context-sensitive attrs.
	- Implemented ->stdout(2) and ->stderr(1), etc.
	- Renamed stdopts method to attropts.
	- push(@EXPORT_OK, MSWIN) constant.

0.46 Sun Jan 16 06:18:11 EST 2000
	- bugfix in functional interface

0.47 Tue Jan 18 21:09:41 EST 2000
	- Regularized handling of qx/qv/ccqv/etc

0.48 Sun Jan 30 22:40:17 EST 2000
	- Renamed 'systemxargs' to 'syxargs'.
	- Renamed 'pathnorm' to 'inpathnorm', and added
	  an 'outpathnorm' method as well.
	- Renamed 'cmd' method to 'argv' (to avoid
	  confusion with $self->ipc_cleartool->cmd()
	  method.
	- Added ->syfail and ->qxfail attributes.
	- Allow hashref attr specifiers to have a leading '-'.

0.49 Wed Feb  2 14:56:04 EST 2000
	- Bugfix - qx() was overwriting stderr output with stdout
	  when both were redirected, in ipc_childsafe mode.
	- Added an "exception-handling" capability. The autofail
	  attr can be a code-ref indicating a function to
	  call on failure, or an array-ref of which the first
	  element is a code-ref as above and the remainder
	  constitutes the arguments to pass to said sub.
	- Allow constructor to be called as ->clone to clone
	  an existing instance.
	- Reworked ipc_childsafe to only allow derived classes
	  access to the coprocess (since the base class cannot
	  directly support it).
	- Reworked attropts() to allow prefix_pattern to be specified.
	- Normalised -dbglevel output somewhat - made normal mode
	  show returned data at dbglevel >= 2 since ipc mode does so.
